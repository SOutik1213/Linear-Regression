# Linear Regression

This repository contains a basic implementation of Linear Regression from scratch using Python and NumPy. The project demonstrates how the Normal Equation is used to fit a linear model to training data without relying on external machine learning libraries.

## Contents

- `LinearModel.py` â€” Contains the LinearRegression class with `fit()` and `predict()` methods.
- `Run.py` â€” Loads training and test data from CSV files and runs the model.
- `train.csv` & `test.csv` â€” Sample datasets used for training and evaluation.

## ðŸ“Š Visualization

The script also includes a simple plot of the training data along with the fitted regression line (for single feature inputs only):

![Regression Plot](./linear_regression_plot.png)

> `output.png` is saved automatically when you run the code.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib (for visualization)

Install using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
ðŸš€ How to Run
bash
Copy
Edit
python Run.py
```
This will:

Load training and testing data from CSV files

Fit a linear model

Predict outputs on test data

Plot the regression line over training data (if one feature)
